**New experimental result: Order effects in AI moral judgment at 6.5σ significance**

I've been exploring whether moral reasoning exhibits quantum-like properties — specifically, whether the *order* in which we consider ethical dimensions affects our conclusions.

Today I'm sharing results from a controlled experiment with Claude (Anthropic's AI):

📊 **Key findings:**
- 29.3% of moral judgments changed based solely on whether "harm" or "intent" was assessed first
- Statistical significance: 6.5σ (exceeds particle physics discovery threshold)
- Morally ambiguous cases showed 3× higher sensitivity to order than clear-cut cases

This is consistent with predictions from Quantum Normative Dynamics — a framework I've been developing that applies quantum field theory formalism to ethical reasoning.

What it means: Moral judgment — at least in AI systems — is not order-invariant. How we structure ethical deliberation affects the outcome. This has implications for AI alignment, prompt engineering, and possibly our understanding of human moral cognition.

What it doesn't mean: This isn't proof that ethics is "literally quantum." The formal structure may be quantum-like without the mechanism being quantum mechanical. More work is needed.

This is Phase 1 of a larger research program. Next steps include replication across models, interference tests, and (ambitiously) Bell inequality experiments for collective moral responsibility.

Feedback welcome — especially from those in quantum cognition, AI ethics, or moral philosophy.

**Experimental result: AI moral judgments depend on assessment order (6.5σ)**

Tested whether asking an AI to evaluate "harm first, then intent" vs "intent first, then harm" affects moral verdicts.

Result: 29.3% of judgments changed based on order alone. Morally ambiguous cases were 3× more sensitive than clear-cut cases.

This is consistent with Quantum Normative Dynamics — a framework applying quantum formalism to ethics. Not proof of "quantum ethics," but strong evidence that moral reasoning has order-dependent structure.
